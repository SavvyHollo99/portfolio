<h3>Elevator Speech</h3>

<h4>I am imaginative.</h4>
<p>I really love to think; and afterward, I really love to create. Since beginning my undergraduate education, I have designed multiple web projects varying in style and target audience. 
I have written content for educational blog posts and web projects as well as for client-based projects.</p>

<h4>I am industrious.</h4>
<p>Maybe it is because procrastination gives me anxiety, but I find that success usually comes to those who work for it. 
In high school, I was Student Government President and Valedictorian. In my time at U.A. Little Rock, I have been on the Chancellorâ€™s List every semester thus far, 
received awards in both my E-commerce major and my I.T. minor, and achieved Senior status by the beginning of my Junior year. 
</p>

<h4>I am resourceful.</h4>
<p>Web development comes with its fair share of obstacles. Whether it is seeing something really cool on the internet and figuring out how to recreate it 
or finding a way to build a WordPress site with a budget of $0, I have to research, negotiate, and problem-solve on a regular basis. 
Sometimes it makes me want to pull out my hair, but when I find the solution I am looking for, it is always rewarding. </p>
