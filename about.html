<p class="speech vov slide-in-up slower">
   I graduated with a B.S. in E-commerce and minors in Information Technology, Psychology, and Marketing. I have experience working for a large-scale corporate company; 
  a university-based research institution; and a small, low-budget non-profit. I look for positions that challenge me creatively and provide opportunities for growth. 
  
  <!--Edited 6/14/23: I am an E-commerce major with minors in Information Technology, Psychology, and Marketing. I have experience working both 
  individually and with a team on client-based projects and university research projects (see the Emerging Analytics Center on my resume).
  I am looking to work for a reputable company in either the marketing and/or web design and development fields.--> </p>

  <h3 class="info-title">I am imaginative.</h3>
  <p class="info-p">As an only child and a habitual bookworm, my mind is a world of its own. I love to brainstorm ideas and have often found myself engaged in good-natured, fruitful debates. 
    My imagination hones my design skills and helps me produce web projects varying in style and purpose; it sparks inspiration when I need to develop content for diverse target audiences; 
    it is the reason I flourish in creative environments and I consider it to be one of my strongest assets. 
    
    <!-- Edited 6/15/23: I really love to think; and afterward, I really love to create. Since beginning my undergraduate education, I have designed 
  multiple web projects varying in style and target audience. I have written content for educational blog posts and web projects as well as for client-based projects.--> </p>

  <h3 class="info-title">I am industrious.</h3>
  <p class="info-p">
    Maybe it is because procrastination gives me anxiety, but I find that working smart and getting things done go hand and hand with success. 
    In high school, I was Student Government President and Valedictorian. In my time at U.A. Little Rock, I was on the Chancellor’s List every semester, received awards in both my E-commerce major and my I.T. minor, 
    was inducted into the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, and graduated Summa Cum Laude.

  <p class="info-p">
    Projects - no matter the size - come with their fair share of obstacles. Whether it is developing a digital identity for a budding research institute or finding a way to build a WordPress site with a budget of $0, 
    I have had to research, negotiate, and stretch my way around many hurdles. 
    <!-- Edited 6/15/23: Both web development and marketing come with their fair share of obstacles. Whether it is developing a digital image and identity for a non-profit
  or finding a way to build a WordPress site with a budget of $0, I have to research, negotiate, and problem-solve on a regular basis. Sometimes it makes me want to pull out my hair, 
    but when I find the solution I am looking for, it is always rewarding. --> </p>
